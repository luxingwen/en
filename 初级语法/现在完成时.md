## 现在完成时

结构：has/have+动词过去分词（p.p)   has/have在这里没意思 主语时第三人称单数用has

过去分词形式通常与过去式一样，不规则动词需单独记忆。

has/have 为助动词。

否定句和疑问句在has/have 上发生变化。

**用法：**

1. 动作在过去已经发生，但对现在的影响依然存在，而且具体发生时间不明，一旦有具体发生的时间，就必须用一般过去时。
  - He has already left.
  - I have already finished my work.
  - We have already had breakfast.
  - My brother has just arrived in Beijing.
  - I have already had three cups of coffee.

  比较：
  - I lost my keys yesterday.
  - Why don't you go home?
  - I have lost my keys.

与一般过去时态的区分：

一般过去时指标是具体过去某时发生的动作，常与以下的时间状语连用：yesterday,last year,last week,3 days ago,in 1998 等。

现在完成时强调一个过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果。常与以下时间状语连用：just(刚刚)，already（已经），never（从不），ever（曾经），yet（还，任然）等。

  - I have already seen the movie.
  - I saw the movie on television last year.
  - I've already had lunch.
  - I had lunch at half past twelve.
  - I've already cleaned my shoes.
  - I cleaned my shoes last night.
  - I opened the window an hour ago.
