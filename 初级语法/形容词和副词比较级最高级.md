## 形容词和副词比较级最高级

英文中大多数形容词副词有三种形式：原级，比较级，最高级。

两者进行比较时用比较级。

三者或三者以上进行比较时用最高级。

#### 比较级最高级构成

1.一般情况词尾加-er构成比较级，加-est构成最高级。
  - tall-taller-tallest
  - hard-harder-hardest
  - great-greater-greatest

2.以-e结尾的词直接加-r/-st。
  - large-larger-largest
  - nice-nicer-nicest

3.以辅音字母加-y结尾的词，把y变为i在加-er/-est。
  - happy-happier-happiest
  - easy-easier-easiest

4.重读闭音节结尾的词双写最后一个辅音字母再加-er/-est
  - hot-hotter-hottest
  - big-bigger-biggest

**比较级最高级用法**

1.比较级只用于两者之间

构成：比较级+than...

若比较的东西比较明显，than之后可以省略。
  - Mary is taller than Susan.
  - My hair is longer than yours.
  - This coat is prettier.
  - Today is warmer.

2.最高级用于三者以上的比较

结构：

the+最高级（+比较范围）

比较范围往往是介词短语或从句（如of all,in the world,in the class)

翻译先确定最重要的。
   - He is the tallest in the class.
   - He is the tallest I have ever seen.
   - This apple is the sweetest I have ever eaten.这个苹果是我吃过的最好吃的
   - This question is easier than that one.这个问题比那个问题容易
   - It's the easiest of them all.这个问题是所有问题中最容易的

   - This man is taller than that one.
   - He is the tallest I have ever seen.
   - This picture is prettier than that one.
   - It's the prettiest I have ever seen.


**多音节词（通常两个音节以上）比较级最高级分别为：**

more +原级

most+原级

 - expensive-more expensive-most expensive
 - famous-more famous-most famous.
 - This car is beautiful.
