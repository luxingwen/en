## 反意疑问句
反意疑问句由两部分组成：前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开。

陈述句若是肯定句则问句用否定形式，陈述句是否定句则问句用肯定形式。

即：前肯后否前否后肯。

**注意：**

1.问句主语需与主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词。

2.前后助动词，时态须保持一致

example

- He won't be late,He will he?
- You are tired,aren't you?
- It isn't going to rain tomorrow,is it?
- He went out,didn't he?
- You love me,don't you?
- He doesn't feel ill,dose he?
- You can wait for me,Can't you?
- There is no water here,is there?
- He hasn't left yet,has he?
- You have been here for a long time,haven't you?
- There are few people left,are there? 重点：出现few就是否定句，few修饰可数名词
- There is little wine left,is there?出现little是否定句，little修饰不可数名词。
